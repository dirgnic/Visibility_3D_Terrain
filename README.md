Box Visibility Analysis
This project implements a 3D visibility determination algorithm using PostgreSQL and PostGIS. The goal is to determine which faces of 3D boxes are visible from a given viewer position. The implementation leverages recursive SQL queries to calculate visibility based on geometric properties like distance and elevation angle.

Overview
This repository demonstrates how to:

Represent 3D boxes and their faces in a spatial database.
Calculate visibility of box faces using recursive SQL queries.
Handle geometric computations with PostGIS functions.
Problem Statement
Given:

A set of 3D boxes, defined by their minimum and maximum corners (x_min, y_min, z_min and x_max, y_max, z_max).
A viewer position defined in 3D space (x, y, z).
Determine:

Which faces of each box are visible or obstructed when viewed from the given position.
Features
Geometric Calculations: Uses PostGIS to compute distances, angles, and intersections.
Recursive SQL: Employs recursive Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for visibility determination.
Efficient Face Handling: Processes faces in order of distance to eliminate redundant computations.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
PostgreSQL (version 12+ recommended).
PostGIS Extension installed in your PostgreSQL instance.
Setup
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/box-visibility-analysis.git
cd box-visibility-analysis
Create a database and enable PostGIS:

sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE visibility_analysis;
\c visibility_analysis
CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
Import the SQL schema and sample data:

sql
Copy code
\i schema.sql
\i sample_data.sql
Usage
Running the Visibility Query
After setting up the database and importing the data:

Run the main visibility query in visibility_query.sql:

sql
Copy code
\i visibility_query.sql
View the results:

Each row shows a box face and whether it is Visible or Obstructed.
How It Works
Data Representation
Each 3D box is represented by its six faces (front, back, left, right, top, bottom).
Faces are stored as polygons in a box_faces table.
Visibility Algorithm
Face Generation:

Create polygon geometries for each face of the boxes.
Distance & Angle Calculation:

Compute the 2D distance and elevation angle of each face relative to the viewer.
Recursive Visibility Check:

Process faces in order of distance, marking a face as visible if:
Its elevation angle is greater than all previously processed angles.
Key SQL Components
PostGIS Functions:

ST_SetSRID and ST_MakePolygon: Define box faces as polygons.
ST_Centroid: Calculate the center of each face.
ST_Distance: Compute the 2D distance from the viewer to each face.
ATAN2: Calculate the elevation angle.
Recursive CTE:

Handles sequential processing of faces to determine visibility.
